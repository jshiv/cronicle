# cronicle
Opinionated workflow scheduler.

## Development Phase: Alpha


Design Doc
----------

Cronicle `will be` a tool for managing and scheduling workflows that leans on the unix philosophy for composition. The features that differentiate cronicle from other similar tools
* focus on tracability and visibility into historical jobs and backfilling
* tight integration with git version control as a mechanisim to track history and changes over time
* no support for data connectors and compute engines, keeping the scope thin. Other tools are better suited for these kinds of tasks


### Why Cronicle
  Other tools I have worked with tend to be bloated in scope and very complicated to setup and use. I want a tool that is easy to comprehend, deploy and use. I basically want distributed cron with job version control. Cronicle will focus on integrating these ideas in a simple way.

  * Simply use git remote for state management.

Usage[Vision]

The tool will use a Cronicle file to maintain `schedule as code`.
A bash job scheulder could look like:
```yaml
#Cronicle.yaml 
job: 
  name: Schedule A
  owner: cronicle
  start_date: 2015-06-01
  end_date: 2019-09-09
  retries: 1
  git: github.com/jshiv/cronicle-sample
  retry_delay: 5 min
  command: echo "Hello World"
```

The tool will use a Cronicle file to maintain `schedule as code`.
A More complete example might look like:
```yaml
#Cronicle.yaml 
job: 
  name: Schedule A
  owner: cronicle
  start_date: 2015-06-01
  end_date: 2019-09-09
  retries: 1
  git: github.com/jshiv/cronicle-sample
  retry_delay: 5 min
    task: 
      name: First Task
      git: github.com/jshiv/cronicle-sample
      path: scripts/
      commit: 29lsjlw09lskjglkalkjgoij2lkj
      command: bash run.sh
    task:
      name: Second Task
      git: github.com/jshiv/cronicle-sample
      command: echo "Second Task"
    task:
      name: Third Task
      git: github.com/jshiv/cronicle-sample
      path: scripts/
      command: echo "Completed All Tasks"
      depends:
        - First Task
        - Second Task
```

# Init
Initilization of the system is managed by the `.cronicle.yaml` file which can be generated by `cronicle init`


# Bash Commands
the run command starts the scheduler.
```bash
cronicle run
```

the history command displays the history of the runnin scheduler
```bash
cronicle history
```
