	Long: `Cronicle runs a centralized cron job that submits shedules to a message queue 
	for consumtion by the worker nodes which will execute all tasks in a given schedule. 
	To start a local distbuted cronicle flow with redis as the message broker:

	# Start a redis broker
	sudo docker run --name redis-cronicle -p 6379:6379 -d redis

	# Setup a cronicle repo
	cronicle init --path=./demo

	# In a seperate shell, start a worker to consume the schedules queue.
	cronicle worker --path ./demo/Cronicle.hcl --queue redis

	# Start cron, in distributed mode "cronicle run" will start a consumer thread by default
	# Note --worker=false will prevent the scheduler from starting a worker thread.
	cronicle run --path ./demo/Cronicle.hcl --worker=false --queue redis 


Multipule workers can be started, they will take turns consuming from the queue.
